## About

This is a Pok√©dex App built with HTML, CSS and Javascript that loads data from an external API and enables the viewing of data points in detail. When a Pokemon is clicked, the image, height, weight of the Pokemon appears on a modal. This modal can then be closed by clicking on the close (x) button, pressing the escape key or clicking outside the modal.
